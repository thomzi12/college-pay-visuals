# college-pay-visuals

This is a repository for an on-going side project to visualize college pay by college. 

This project began after I encounted data released by the Department of Education during my senior year of college (2015) with details numbers on student outcomes by colleges. 

At the moment, I'm using a dataset I created by merging information from the following two sources: 
  * https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
  * https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Data.aspx

Topics to covered by this visualization include: 
  * Pay by decile for graduates of a particular college 
  * The gender pay gap for each college 

Tools to used to present the above include 
  * Python (via Jupyter Notebooks) to clean data 
  * matplotlib to visualize information 
  * CartoDB to map findings 
  * D3 to create interactive dashboards to examine data for your institution of interest
